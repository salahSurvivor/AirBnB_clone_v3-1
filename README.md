Description 📝

Welcome to hbnb, the wacky clone of the renowned AirBnB web application! We've gone through four phases of zany development to bring you this spectacular version. In this release, we've sprinkled Phase 1's Console and web static, Phase 2's MySQL magic, and Phase 3's JSON web interface with a dash of RESTful API goodness!

Purpose 🚀

Phase 3 aims to teach you how to:

Create a custom RESTful API
Use CORS like a boss
Request and manipulate objects with HTTP methods
Retrieve, create, update, and delete resources with swagger and flair!

Requirements 🛠️

All files must be compiled with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Documentation should be as organized as your sock drawer
Python unit tests should make you chuckle
PEP8 compliance is the cool kid in town

File Descriptions 📁

Buckle up for a rollercoaster ride through our file structure! Here's a sneak peek:

tests: Home to unit test files where magic and mayhem collide.
models: Where all our class models for AirBnB objects hang out.

And much more!
